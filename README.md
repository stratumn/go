## Run tests

You need Docker to be able to run the tests. The images `rethink:latest` and
`postgres:latest` will be run automatically (and pulled from the docker hub if
you don't already have them locally).

Install dependencies:

```bash
go get -u github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep
dep ensure
```

To manage dependencies, see [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep).

Run all tests:

```bash
make test
```

See test coverage in the browser:

```bash
make coverhtml
```

Run the linter:

```bash
go get -u github.com/golang/lint/golint
make lint
```

Build tagged docker images:

```bash
make docker_images
```
