The SDK includes tools to build [Proof of Process Networks](https://proofofprocess.org) using the [Indigo Framework](https://indigoframework.com).

To get started, visit the Indigo Framework website:

## Run tests

You need Docker to be able to run the tests. The images `couchstore:latest`, `rethink:latest` and
`postgres:latest` will be run automatically (and pulled from the docker hub if
you don't already have them locally).

Install dependencies:

```bash
go get -u github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep
dep ensure
```

To manage dependencies, see [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep).

Run all tests:

```bash
make test
```

See test coverage in the browser:

```bash
make coverhtml
```

Run the linter:

```bash
go get -u github.com/golang/lint/golint
make lint
```

Build tagged docker images:

```bash
make docker_images
```

## Releasing a new version

If you want to release a new version of the Stratumn SDK, here is what you need to do.
You need to install:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [Keybase](https://keybase.io/)
* [github-release](https://github.com/aktau/github-release/releases/)

You'll need to add your PGP public key to strat/cmd/pubkey.go

Then at the root of the repo:

* Update the CHANGELOG file
* Create a branch named vA.B.x (for example: 0.1.x) from master
* On this new branch, create a VERSION file that contains the version (for example: 0.1.0)
* Set the pre-release flag in PRERELEASE if needed
* Run _make release_ (this will create the tag, build the binaries and the docker images, push the docker images and publish a release on Github)
